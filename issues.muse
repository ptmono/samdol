* problem with error handling
#1304161620

Today I fixed a problem to support following url
 - http://www.saramin.co.kr/zf_user/recruit/view/idx/15055533

The reason of following error is that samdolc fails to parse the url

On chrome-extension the response message continuously shows "Parsing...".
It seems good in which the message box shows the error. How about to apply
the exception into command decorator to solve this problem.



* problems about rating
#1303291012

 - Why 6 star ?

* additional url
#1301240542

Parse following url

http://www.saramin.co.kr/zf_user/special-recruit/list/bcode/48/code/D8/page/1/pageCount/80/CategoryViewFlag/1/recIdx/14005356

http://www.saramin.co.kr/zf_user/special-recruit/list/bcode/51/code/E1/search_area/2/page/1/pageCount/80/CategoryViewFlag/1/recIdx/14053736

* [DONE] It is problem rpm update
#1302080444

We have to remove samdolc before install.


* [DONE] Container encoding error with urllib

Current time, parser.Container uses PyQt to get the source of page. The
reason is urllib has decoding problem with urllib. PyQt need few second to
get the source. urllib is fast than.
